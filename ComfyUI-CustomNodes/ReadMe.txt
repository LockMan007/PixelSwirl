various custom nodes i made

I made these, because someone else didn't.

Feel free to use them or integrate the code into your own custom node(s) to add features or to re-create these with changes you want or features you want.

Also, feel free to go to Discussions or Pull Requests and put in requests for changes you believe would improve them.
If I understand and I want those changes, I'll do it.
