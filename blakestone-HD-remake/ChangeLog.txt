Confirmed that the sprite sheet for the walking animations doesn't math the AI upscale order.
I'm not sure which is wrong. The sprite sheet order makes more sense, whereas the AI upscale order is every 9th image.
I'm trying to decide what the best approach would be, because the images are so similar, that re-numbering them would be a real tedious pain.
I'm going to have to assume the AI upscale for the source port is the correct order for the source port.

First change log.

I've been doing everything the hard way and making lots of mistakes.
While everything won't be quick and effortless now, at least I won't repeat past mistakes.
I use a white background for the images, so that if it casts a light on the NPC, it will be white, not pink/purple.
I might redo some of the original images if i see graphical glitches in the white suit, which was a result of Fuchsia color removal.
I might fix the number of red pens in his pocket to 2. This is a small imperfection and getting the base images done first, is priority.
I am now resizing them to 1229x1024 then cropping canvas to 1024x1024 to ensure the image will remain centered.
I now have a non-resized folder available with the images I previously had in this root folder.
I realize my sprite sheet does not match the AI upscaled images for Walking, so I am going to go with what the AI UPSCALE order is, assuming the spritesheet i found is wrong.
