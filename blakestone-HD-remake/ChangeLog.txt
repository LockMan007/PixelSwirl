First change log.

I've been doing everything the hard way and making lots of mistakes.
While everything won't be quick and effortless now, at least I won't repeat past mistakes.
I use a white background for the images, so that if it casts a light on the NPC, it will be white, not pink/purple.
I might redo some of the original images if i see graphical glitches in the white suit, which was a result of Fuchsia color removal.
I might fix the number of red pens in his pocket to 2. This is a small imperfection and getting the base images done first, is priority.
I am now resizing them to 1229x1024 then cropping canvas to 1024x1024 to ensure the image will remain centered.
I now have a non-resized folder available with the images I previously had in this root folder.
I realize my sprite sheet does not match the AI upscaled images for Walking, so I am going to go with what the AI UPSCALE order is, assuming the spritesheet i found is wrong.

TODO: Rest of frames.
