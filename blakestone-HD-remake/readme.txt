THIS IS INCOMPLETE.
A WORK IN PROGRESS.
I still need to do 270-305 (35 frames)

My old method:
getting rid of fuchsia color background from upscaled images was a MASSIVE pain.
The fuchsia color acts like a light and shines onto the character, which makes it very difficult to remove without destroying the image.

I did color replace, 
and then Due/Saturation to change Fuchsia to white, but now the white is left behind.
then added a black stroke/outline.

info:
I've had to manually edit every picture many times, so don't think this is just "oh he just gave the image to AI and said 'do it'" because in spite of how good AI is, and all my experience with AI, it's still not perfect, even with Nano Banana.

UPDATED method: I am now using a white background.
There is no need to use Fuchsia in 2025, it's just going to cause problems unless you are doing pixel by pixel editing and no transparency.

I'm using Z-Image on my local GPU and photoshop.
It takes a lot of attempts to get a face that matches and a minimal amount of image defects.
Often the informant clipboard is wrong and i have to manually fix it, as long as it gets the size close enough, sometimes it makes it square.

My images here are for addictions to the Fan made AI Upscale, as an alternative for this one character in the game.
The person who made teh AI upscale is currently working on doing it themselves with their own art style, to fix the issues.
