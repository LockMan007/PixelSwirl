getting rid of fuchsia color background is a MASSIVE pain.
The fuchsia color acts like a light and shines onto the character, which makes it very difficult to remove without destroying the image.

I did color replace, 
and then Due/Saturation to change Fuchsia to white, but now the white is left behind.
then added a black stroke/outline.

I've had to manually edit every picture many times, so don't think this is just "oh he just gave the image to AI and said 'do it'" because in spite of how good AI is, and all my experience with AI, it's still not perfect, even with Nano Banana.

UPDATE: I am now using a white background.
There is no need to use Fuchsia in 2025, it's just going to cause problems.

I'm using Z-Image on my local GPU and photoshop.
