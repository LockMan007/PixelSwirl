These are the original files I made.
I now know that the 1024x1024 images stretch in the source port.
So I am resizing them to 1229x1024 and then pasting them into the 1024x1024 image frame, so that when they get put into the game, the sprite itself will resize back to almost exactly 1024x1024.
However, this is not exact, so the resulting image will not be as perfect as these original files.
If you use the images in this folder, they will be stretched too tall by 20%
however, if the source port changes or someone else makes a port that doesn't stretch, then these are the better images to use.
