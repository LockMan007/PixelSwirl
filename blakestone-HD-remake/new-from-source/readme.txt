Currently, these have a pink/purple background, which i need to remove.

i'm trying to use the source images with more detailed prompts, based on what i think the image is.
I'm doing tons of seeds and changing lots of settings to try to get images similar.


using a prompt that i change a lot, that is basically a form of this:

Lab technician in white long sleeve lab coat uniform, black hair, holding the side of a black bordered clipboard, yellow paper with sideways written text on it beside him in one hand, fuchsia background, cartoon graphics, blue eyes, high resolution, black shoes, wide fat head, 2 black shirt buttons, expressionless, focused attention

negative prompt:
beard, mustache, shadow, pixels, pixelated, lowres, low resolution, bad quality, blurry, blocky, voxel, voxels, cubes, blurry, happy, smile, angry, mad, grin, cheerful, jovial, smirk, sneer, excited

using 0.65 deoise, 7 steps, 1 cfg 
Model: z-image
seed: 102970954659458
seed has to change sometimes to get the right output.
