work in progress

UPDATE: 1/2/2026
I now found a sprite sheet.
I can cut up a sprite sheet.
I am going to see if I can re-upscale from the original.
Hopefully I'll get better quality and be more accurate.

Apparently the red U shape is supposed to be 2 pens, because they are lab workers or scientists, 
which they would need pens to write on the clipboard.

I'll end up making 2 folders, eventually "OLD" will be my original AI to AI.
Then this main folder I'll do my Original to AI/photoshop edit.

While some people may think "he's just running it through AI, that is easy and no effort",
but I am doing far more work than that to make this work.
