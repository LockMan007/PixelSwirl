I hate that F.Lux automatically changes my brightness in the morning.
I made this app that does nothing automatically.
That way I can use the same hotkeys:
ALT+Page Up
ALT+Page Down
to change the backlight brightness.

I tried adding some features to the icon, but ran out of credits and tried the changes in 2.5 flash and it broke the app with tons of errors.
